# Debias autoencoder
Master thesis<br><br>

This model is based on autoencoder, which aims to decrease the discrimination on unbalanced dataset. The corresponding model and experiments' results have already been sorted in the publisched thesis [*FairNN - Conjoint Learning of Fair Representations for Fair Decisions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02173), which is accepted by DS2020, please read the thesis if you have interests to know more details about this idea. This repository is only a design-demo by experiment, not the final version.
